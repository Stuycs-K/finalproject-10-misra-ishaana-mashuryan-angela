### Project Description:

Our project is a smaller-scale version of the real-life Bitcoin blockchain. The purpose is to allow users to experience making, sending, and receiving transactions within the scope of a tutorial. Users are also able to mine blocks, experience how Bitcoins are created, how wallets function, and witness the cryptographic security measures behind digital signatures and IDs.
